# Steps to test out this POC

1. First of all, you need to start the server in your machine and host the sample  wiki file.

You can also study on how to start working with fastapi here - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/
Believe me , it wont take more than 5 minutes to kickstart your server with sample page deployed, if you follow these steps:
go to your terminal and run these commands :

pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"



locate your file using terminal. and run this command - 
uvicorn sample_wiki:app --reload

It should show something like this :

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [27570] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [27572]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.

2. Now you can run your crawler from terminal using python command - python main.py
